The code used to play matches in the Code4Life contest from [codingame platform](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code4life).
Written in both Scala and Rust Programming Languages.

## Strategies

### Scala Programming Language :
**Wood**

Main strategy to win the other robot is finding the best sample according its health point. It searchs samples from the created samples array and compare their health point then selects a samples which has max health as a best sample.

- **DIAGNOSIS** : If sample that chosen as a best sample according to the strategy is not carried by our robot then it goes to DIAGNOSIS module and CONNECT sample with sample id.
- **MOLECULES** : Get molecules that needed from the chosen best sample as searcing if we have molecules that costs of sample has. CONNECT molecules.
Then go to LABORATORY
- **LABORATORY** : It takes molecules and sample then produce the medicine.Because we chosed the best sample, we get the highest health point and increase our score.

**Wood to Bronze**

In this part we have extra module as SAMPLE which robots will collect samples from it instead of from DIAGNOSIS.So ,sample data could be diagnosed or undiagnosed. In addition, as an extra we have rank:1,2,3.The higher rank gets the higher health point.

- **SAMPLES** : Here it connects undiagnosed samples with CONNECT rank. Strategy in here again is having sample gives most health.The higher rank the more health point you will get. 

    *Health points scored with a rank 1 sample = 1 or 10*

    *Health points scored with a rank 2 sample = 10, 20 or 30*

    *Health points scored with a rank 3 sample = 30, 40 or 50*

    *3≤ Total molecule cost for a rank 1 sample ≤5*

    *5≤ Total molecule cost for a rank 2 sample ≤8*

    *7≤ Total molecule cost for a rank 3 sample ≤14*

But because we have constraint that at most 10 molecule we are able to carry, we can't choose rank 3 directly for our strategy.Also,Rank 1 is not enough to win the other robot.Because available molecules still unlimited in this section we can select rank 2 and win the game. 
- **DIAGNOSIS** : It diagnoses every sample is given.
- **MOLECULES** : Here is the strategy and implementation same with wood section.Getting molecules that needed from the chosen best sample.
- **LABORATORY** : It takes molecules and sample then produce the medicine. Because we chose rank 2. we will get 10,20 or 30 health point and it is enough to win other robot.



### Rust Programming Language :
**Wood**

In this part we didn't use the same strategy as we used for Scala language. Because the strategy we used before for selecting the best sample requires mutable assignments.However, Rust language is not enough convenient to implement this strategy we implement our code more functional where every function call another.

- **DIAGNOSIS** : 
- **MOLECULES** : 
- **LABORATORY** :
